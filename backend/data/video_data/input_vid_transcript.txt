And, Dad, you know that male man that you got fired? Didn't steal your playboys? Ross did. I can't. I'm a hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica, Dad. Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year. Monica and Chandler are living together! Ross, Mary, Rachel and Vegas, and God divorced! I can! I'm no shocker stone!
