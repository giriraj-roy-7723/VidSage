 Imagine you can make transactions with anyone without carrying any cash or plastic money, and without anyone actually interfering like third party applications or banks. Sounds like a nice dream, right? Well, it's not. Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has changed how transactions work. It intends to provide a safe and secure mode of transactions, by using digital cryptocurrencies that cannot be manipulated by anyone with ulterior motives. Blockchain is a set of blocks that record information of transactions like who made the transactions to whom. The amount of trade in the form of a digital ledger that is distributed across the entire network, making it more secure and impossible to change, hack or cheat the system. Then it is verified and validated by every node in the blockchain network to proceed with the process of making the transactions. It's cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many more that make use of this blockchain network for transactions, as it helps you keep track of them as the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency. Almost every day new cryptocurrencies are coming in front and more and more people are willing to participate in this revolution of the economy. Blockchain is believed to revolutionize the economy and technology of the world in the coming future. And like Fred Esram, co-founder of Coinbase said, everything will be tokenized and connected by a blockchain one day.
